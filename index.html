        <h4>How to use...</h4>
        <p>
          Follow these steps and find out the top 100 most frequently
          occurring words from a text file:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Click to "Choose File" near the top.</li>
          <li>Select a file.</li>
          <li>Explore a list of words from most occurances to least.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Things to note...</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>The list returns only the top 100 frequently occurring unique words.</li>
          <li>It's ok if the file does not contain more than 100 unique words. An appropriate list will be created.</li>
          <li>If you want to get a list from another text file simply click on "Choose File" again and select the desired file.</li>
          <li>Stop-Words will be <strong>NOT</strong> be on the list. (For more information see below)</li>
        </ul>
